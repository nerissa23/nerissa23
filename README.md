### <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/VgCDAzcKvsR6OM0uWg/giphy.gif" width="50"> A little bit about me:
I am 22 years old, and I have a deep found interest in building software solutions that can enhance a regular citizen (whether you're a teacher, college student, a finance manager, etc.)'s life. One of my major interests at the moment is building a mobile app-based system that detects live occupancies in scattered parking lots to let users know of available parking in busy streets easily from just a tap on their smartphones (which FYI, also happens to be my final-year project for degree!). Over the last few years of studying software engineering, I have grown to be easily fascinated and inspired by existing solutions in the market that actively impacts the society's routinely lives such as Setel, Waze, and more.

I am also someone who enjoys collaborating with others on fun projects as a way to upskill our technical expertise. If you'd like to reach me, let's connect here on GitHub!
